## Overview

Development of a secure, scalable CRM system specifically designed for financial services firms, with a focus on compliance, data security, and streamlined client management.

## Key Features

- **Client Management**: Built a comprehensive system for tracking client interactions, documents, and financial history with role-based access controls.
- **Compliance Dashboard**: Implemented automated compliance monitoring with regulatory updates and audit trails to ensure adherence to financial regulations.
- **Reporting & Analytics**: Created customizable reporting tools that generate insights on client portfolios, advisor performance, and business metrics.
- **Secure Document Management**: Developed an encrypted document storage and sharing system that maintains compliance with financial data protection standards.

## Technologies Used

- **React & TypeScript**: For building a robust, type-safe frontend application.
- **Node.js & Express**: For creating a scalable backend API architecture.
- **PostgreSQL**: For secure, relational data storage with complex financial relationships.
- **AWS Services**: Leveraging S3 for document storage, Lambda for serverless functions, and CloudFront for content delivery.

## Challenges and Learnings

A significant challenge was balancing security requirements with usability. We implemented a zero-trust security model while maintaining an intuitive user experience through careful UX design and progressive authentication. Another challenge was creating a flexible reporting system that could accommodate the diverse needs of different financial service providers.

## Outcome

The CRM system has been successfully deployed to multiple financial services firms, resulting in a 35% reduction in administrative tasks, improved compliance reporting efficiency, and enhanced client satisfaction through more personalized service delivery.
